Project Documentation: Movie List Application

Overview :

This Angular project is designed to fetch and display a list of movies based on genre from an API. It uses NgRx for state management and Angular CDK for implementing virtual scrolling, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience even with large datasets.

1. Implementation Details

    1.1 Data Fetching and Display
        API Integration: The project fetches movie data from a specified API endpoint. The data is filtered based on genre and then displayed in a list format.
        UI Rendering: The list of movies is rendered using Angular's powerful templating system, ensuring that only the visible items are displayed, optimizing performance.

    1.2 State Management with NgRx
        NgRx: NgRx is used to manage the application state, including storing the fetched movie data and handling user interactions. This allows for a centralized store where all the application data is managed, leading to easier debugging and a more maintainable codebase.

    1.3 Virtual Scrolling with Angular CDK
        Virtual Scrolling: Angular CDK’s virtual scrolling module is utilized to handle the rendering of the movie list. This ensures that only the visible items are rendered in the DOM, significantly improving performance, especially with large datasets.
        Smooth Scrolling: Smooth transitions are implemented to provide a seamless scrolling experience.

2. Architectural Choices

    2.1 State Management
        Why NgRx?: NgRx is chosen because it provides robust state management features, including:
        Centralized State: All application data is managed in a single place, making it easier to track changes and manage the flow of data.
        Predictable State Changes: Using actions and reducers ensures that state changes are predictable and easy to debug.
        Scalability: NgRx is well-suited for large applications with complex data flows, making it a good fit for this project.

    2.2 Virtual Scrolling
        Why Angular CDK?: The Angular CDK was chosen for implementing virtual scrolling because:
        Ease of Use: Angular CDK provides a straightforward API and easy-to-use components for implementing virtual scrolling.
        Performance: It efficiently handles large lists by only rendering visible items, which is crucial for maintaining good performance in a data-heavy application.
        Flexibility: The CDK allows for customization and is adaptable to various use cases, making it a versatile choice for this project.

3. Edge Case Handling

    3.1 Slow Network Conditions
    Solution: Implemented loading spinners and retry mechanisms using Angular’s HttpClient. This ensures that the user is informed when data is loading and that the application can recover from temporary network issues.

    3.2 Rapid Scrolling
    Solution: Debouncing is applied to limit the frequency of API calls during rapid scrolling, preventing unnecessary load on the server and ensuring a smooth user experience.

    3.3 Re-rendering on Window Resize
    Solution: The application listens for window resize events and adjusts the virtual scroll viewport accordingly. This ensures that the list is re-rendered correctly when the window size changes, maintaining the user experience across different screen sizes.
